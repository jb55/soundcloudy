  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jb55/soundcloudy.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/jb55/soundcloudy)

## Installation

  Install with npm

    $ npm install soundcloudy

## Example

```js
var co = require('co');
var soundcloud = require('soundcloudy');
var request = soundcloud(clientId);

// user
var user = 'monstercat'

co(function* () {
  // single page
  var tracks = yield request()
    .resource('users/%s/tracks', user)
    .run()

  // all pages with fast pagination
  var tracks = yield request()
    .resource('users/%s/tracks', user);
    .concurrency(3)
    .all()
})();

```

## API

### soundcloudy(clientId)

returns: Request

### Request.resource(route[, route convenience formatters, ...])

returns: Request

Set the location for the request

### Request.param(key, value)

returns: Request

Querystring parameter

### Request.run()

returns: `co` yieldable

Run a single request

### Request.all([concurrency || 3])

returns: `co` yieldable

Keep running requests until all pages are fetched. Use `concurrency` to
adjust request batching. `all` does requests optimistically until all pages are
retrieved.
